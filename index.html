All radioactive particles have ‘half life’—the time it takes for the particle to radiate away half of its’ mass, hence, by seeing the amount of radiation left in artifacts and comparing it with a fresh sample, one can determine the age.</li>
                <li>Immersed myself in astronomy, learned the processes and practices in archaeology. Produced a model and presented it to the school, popularizing science.</li>
